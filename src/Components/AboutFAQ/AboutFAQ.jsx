      question: "How can I apply for financing?",
      answer:
        "You can apply online on the checkout page after you have reserved your car. We have partnered with several financing institutions in order to provide you with flexible financing options. You will also be able to calculate your expected monthly installments online, depending on your preferred tenor, downpayment, and your choice of a plan type (with car sale ban, or without a car sale ban). Once you complete your online application, our team will process your application with the financing institutions and we will contact you to update you on the progress and status of your application.",
